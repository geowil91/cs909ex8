CS909 Data Mining Exercise 8 (1005506)

In order for the script to work, the following libraries must be installed:
-beautifulsoup4
-numpy
-nltk
-pylab
-scikit-learn
-scipy
-lxml

The directory containing the XML version of the Reuters corpus (named 'reuters21578-xml') must be located in the same directory as the exercise8.py script. It has been uploaded to the repo for convenience.

This script should simply be run from the shell, with the command 'python exercise8.py' from within the directory, assuming Python is installed.

The Ward clustering algorithm has been commented out as it takes over 90 minutes to execute, but output should be identical to that in the Appendix below.
